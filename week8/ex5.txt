Physical memory (also called RAM) is preferable, fast, memory, which is used as much as possible

However, when we do not have enough ram for our program we can use memory of our hard drive(like swap area)
Virtual mempory is like an interface  between our program and different kind of memories, it uses page table to map to ram or disk
